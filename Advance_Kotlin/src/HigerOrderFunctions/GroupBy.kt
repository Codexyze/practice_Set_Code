    // Very useful when we need to categorize data automatically.
    //
    // Example: Grouping words by their first letter.

    val words = listOf("apple", "ant", "banana", "bat", "ball", "cat")

    // Group words based on their starting character
    val grouped = words.groupingBy { word ->
        word.first() // key is the first letter
    }.eachCount() // we can also count how many words in each group
